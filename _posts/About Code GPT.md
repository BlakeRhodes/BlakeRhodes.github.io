Introducing the [About Code GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6770c555e1448191a149a1e13b728d35-about-code)

Hey there, welcome to my site! Let me give you a quick rundown of what this [GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6770c555e1448191a149a1e13b728d35-about-code)is all about and why I’ve added it here.

So, I’ve been diving deep into some pretty exciting concepts—things like **English as a programming language**, how **agents** are evolving, and the endless ways AI is reshaping tech. But I know not everyone lives and breathes this stuff the way I do (and honestly, who has the time?). That’s where this GPT comes in.

### Why It’s Here:

Think of it as your guide to the ideas I’m exploring. Whether it’s understanding how natural language can become executable code, or why distributed, event-driven systems are so powerful, this GPT is here to break it down for you. My goal? To make these concepts less intimidating and way more approachable. I want everyone to be able to engage with this world—not just the folks who already speak the language of AI and software.

### How It Works:

When you ask a question, this GPT taps into my writings and explains things like I would if we were chatting. It sticks to my style—reflective, a little humorous, and always trying to balance the big picture with practical examples. It’s like having a one-on-one conversation with me, minus the part where I ramble about D&D analogies for an hour.

### What It’s Great At:

- **Breaking Down Complexity:** If something I’ve written feels a bit too dense or jargon-y, this GPT can explain it in simpler terms without losing the meaning.
- **Adding Context:** Maybe you’re wondering what the heck I mean by “agents,” or why I’m obsessed with declarative systems. This GPT’s got you.
- **Guiding Your Exploration:** I want you to be curious. If you’re reading about EaaPL or long-running agents and wondering “Where do I even start?”—this GPT is your launch pad.

### Why I Built It:

Honestly, I just want more people to feel excited about this stuff. I’m a big believer that tech (especially AI) shouldn’t feel like some exclusive club. It should feel like an invitation—to learn, to build, to imagine. This GPT is my way of opening the door wider, so jump in, ask questions, and explore. And if you’re still stumped, hit me up directly—I’m always happy to chat.
