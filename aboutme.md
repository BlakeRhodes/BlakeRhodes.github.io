subtitle: AI Innovation with a Side of Creativity

Hi, I’m Blake Rhodes, an AI enthusiast and thought leader with a passion for developing cutting-edge applications that push the boundaries of what’s possible in tech. My primary focus is on artificial intelligence, where I explore both the technical and philosophical implications of how AI can transform industries and lives.

Beyond AI, I love diving into complex networking setups (if you ever need to segment IoT devices, I’m your go-to!). I’m always tweaking and optimizing, whether it’s setting up advanced virtual labs or experimenting with new frameworks like gptsh, my latest project aimed at integrating AI into command-line environments. It’s a fun mix of efficiency and intelligence—and it's just the beginning.

When I’m not deep into code, you’ll find me out exploring the world through photography, or hunting down the best new spots to eat. I’m a serious foodie who’s always up for trying something new, from street food to fine dining.

Let’s connect—whether it’s about AI, networking wizardry, or sharing the best food finds!
